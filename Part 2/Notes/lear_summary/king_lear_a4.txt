SCENE I

Still disguised as ‘Poor Tom’, Edgar comes across his blinded father being led away from his house by an old man who lived on Gloucester’s land and is horrified to see his father in this state. He hears Gloucester tell the old man ‘I have no way and therefore want no eyes / I stumbled when I saw’, and confessing that he was unfair to his son Edgar. On hearing that ‘Poor Tom’ is there, Gloucester asks the ‘naked fellow’ to lead him to the cliffs at Dover. The old man is not convinced this is a good idea but Gloucester tells him ‘Tis the time’s plague, when madmen lead the blind.’

=======================

SCENE II

Goneril arrives home with Edmund and Oswald tells her that Albany is behaving oddly and smiled at the news of the French invasion. Goneril sends Edmund back to Cornwall but kisses him first and tells him ‘To thee a woman’s services are due’. Albany says the sisters’ treatment of Lear makes them ‘Tigers, not daughters’. Goneril calls her husband ‘Milk-livered man’ and ‘a moral fool’ and they continue to argue until a messenger arrives with news that Cornwall has died from the wound he got fighting his servant. Albany is shocked to hear what Cornwall did to Gloucester and that it was Edmund who betrayed his father. Goneril is concerned that Regan will make a move on Edmund now she is a widow. After Goneril has left, Albany declares ‘Gloucester, I live / To thank thee for the love thou showed’st the king / And to revenge thine eyes.’

===========================

SCENE III

Kent talks to a gentleman in Dover about the letters he sent to Cordelia about her father. The gentleman tells him that Cordelia was very emotional reading the letters so that her ‘tears and smiles’ were like ‘Sunshine and rain at once’. Kent tells the gentleman that Lear is nearby but that ‘burning shame / Detains him from Cordelia’.

=========================

SCENE IV

Cordelia is concerned about her father who has been seen ‘As mad as the vexed sea, singing aloud’ and wearing a crown of ‘furrow weeds’. She sends people to ‘Search every acre in the high-grown field / And bring him to our eye’. A messenger comes in to tell her ‘The British powers are marching hitherward’ and she gets ready for battle saying ‘O dear father, / It is thy business that I go about’.

======================

SCENE V

Regan talks about the impending battle with Oswald who has just brought messages to her from Goneril. She tries to get him to reveal what is in the messages he carries from Goneril to Edmund, saying ‘I know you are of her bosom’ but Oswald remains loyal to Goneril and tells Regan ‘My lady charged my duty in this business.’ Regan gives him her own message to take to Edmund and tells him that if he meets ‘that blind traitor’ Gloucester, ‘Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.’

======================

SCENE VI

Edgar has led his blinded father to Dover, still pretending to be ‘Poor Tom’ although Gloucester recognises that his guide’s ‘voice is altered’. Despite Gloucester also recognising that ‘the ground is even’, Edgar convinces him that they are at the top of a high cliff from which ‘The fishermen that walk upon the beach /Appear like mice’. Gloucester sends his guide away with ‘another purse’.

When Gloucester falls forward, believing he is throwing himself from the cliff top, Edgar confesses that his plan may ‘may rob / The treasury of life’ and rushes to his father to check if he is still alive. He now pretends to be a passer by on the beach who saw the old man fall and declares ‘Thy life’s a miracle’. Gloucester agrees to ‘bear / Affliction till it do cry out itself /‘Enough, enough’ and die.’

At that moment King Lear joins them, behaving very oddly and ranting about his daughters. Gloucester recognises the king’s voice. Lear comments on Gloucester’s lack of eyes and tells him ‘A man may see how this world goes with no eyes. / Look with thine ears’.

Lear finally admits, ‘I know thee well enough: thy name is Gloucester’ before running off, chased by three gentlemen sent to calm him down and take him to Cordelia. Edgar learns from one of the gentleman that the opposing army are ‘Near and on speedy foot’.

Edgar tells Gloucester he is ‘A most poor man, made tame to fortune’s blows’ and begins to lead him to shelter when Oswald appears, ready to kill Gloucester. Edgar defends Gloucester and kills Oswald who dies believing Edgar is a ‘bold peasant’. He gives Edgar his purse and tells him to ‘bury my body / And give the letters which thou find’st about me / To Edmund, Earl of Gloucester’.

Edgar reads aloud the letter from Goneril to Edmund which asks Edmund to take one of the ‘many opportunities’ he will have to kill Albany so that he can marry Goneril. Edgar disposes of Oswald’s body and then leads his father away.

========================

SCENE VII

Cordelia asks Kent ‘how shall I live and work / To match thy goodness?’ and he asks her not to reveal his identity until he is ready. A doctor tells Cordelia that the king ‘sleeps still’ and asks if they can wake him. Lear is brought in and Cordelia kisses him, judging her sisters by saying ‘Had you not been their father, these white flakes / Did challenge pity of them.’ Lear is confused when he wakes up but seems more calm and rational. He calls himself ‘a very foolish fond old man.’ He recognises Cordelia and tells her ‘your sisters / Have, as I do remember, done me wrong: / You have some cause, they have not.’ The doctor reassures Cordelia saying, ‘Be comforted, good madam: the great rage, / You see, is killed in him.’

SCENE I

Kent is looking for the king and a gentleman tells him that Lear is ‘Contending with the fretful elements’, accompanied by ‘None but the fool’. Kent tells the gentleman of difficulty ‘’twixt Albany and Cornwall’ and that spies in their courts are reporting back to Cordelia’s husband the King of France. Kent sends the gentleman with a ring to find Cordelia.

======================

SCENE II

Lear shouts at the stormy skies ‘Blow winds and crack your cheeks!’ The Fool tries to calm him down but Lear continues to complain to the elements that they are taking his daughters’ side ‘gainst a head / So old and white as this’. Kent finds them and persuades Lear to head towards the shelter of ‘a hovel’ and the king finally agrees, showing sympathy for the Fool, ‘Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart / That’s sorry yet for thee.’

=========================

SCENE III

Gloucester confides in Edmund his concerns about how Regan, Goneril and Cornwall have forbidden him to help Lear. He tells Edmund of a letter locked in his closet that is ‘dangerous to be spoken’ and that ‘there is part of a power already footed’ to revenge ‘these injuries the king now bears’. As soon as Gloucester leaves, Edmund tells the audience that he will immediately report all of this to Cornwall.

============================

SCENE IV

Kent has led Lear to the hovel and urges him to go in. Before he enters, Lear thinks about the ‘Poor naked wretches’ in his kingdom who have no shelter and confesses ‘I have ta’en / Too little care of this’. Just then the Fool comes back out of the hovel, scared of ‘a spirit’ inside it called ‘Poor Tom’. Edgar emerges disguised as Poor Tom, behaving and speaking like a ‘Bedlam beggar’. Lear is intrigued by Poor Tom and considers how ‘unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor bare, forked animal’. He begins to take off his own clothes to be more like ‘Poor Tom’. At this moment, Gloucester finds them. He tells Lear ‘my duty cannot suffer / T’obey in all your daughters’ hard commands’ and says he will take them to where ‘both fire and food is ready.’ Lear agrees to follow but not without his ‘Noble philosopher’ ‘Poor Tom’.

=============================

SCENE V

Edmund tells Cornwall what his father told him and shows Cornwall Gloucester’s letter which ‘approves him an intelligent party to the advantages of France’ and therefore a traitor to his own country. Cornwall praises his action, telling him ‘it hath made thee Earl of Gloucester.’

===============================

SCENE VI

Gloucester brings Lear, Kent, ‘Poor Tom’ and the Fool to a place of shelter near his house. Lear continues to complain about how his daughters have treated him, and sets up a mock trial of Regan and Goneril. Kent eventually persuades him to rest but then Gloucester returns and tells Kent they must leave immediately and ‘drive toward Dover, friend, where thou shalt meet / Both welcome and protection.’ The Fool speaks his last lines in the play.

==============================

SCENE VII

Regan and Goneril are angry to hear of Gloucester’s betrayal, Regan says ‘Hang him instantly’ and Goneril adds ‘Pluck out his eyes.’ Oswald arrives with news that Lear and ‘Some five- or six-and-thirty of his knights’ have gone toward Dover, where they boast / To have well-arme`d friends.’ Goneril sets off back to her house, accompanied by Edmund, while Cornwall sends servants to bring in ‘the traitor Gloucester’.

Gloucester is brought in and protests ‘Good my friends, consider you are my guests / Do me no foul play, friends’ but he is tied to a chair and interrogated. He tells Regan he has sent Lear to Dover ‘because I would not see thy cruel nails / Pluck out his poor old eyes’. In response, Cornwall gouges out one of Gloucester’s eyes but before he can take out the other eye a servant calls ‘Hold your hand, my lord’. Cornwall fights with the servant and kills him then returns to pluck out Gloucester’s remaining eye, saying ‘Out vile jelly’. Gloucester calls out for Edmund but Regan tells him it was Edmund ‘That made the overture of thy treasons to us’.

Gloucester finally realises he has trusted the wrong son. Cornwall has been hurt in the fight with his servant. Regan orders the remaining servants to ‘Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell / His way to Dover’ and then helps her bleeding husband.

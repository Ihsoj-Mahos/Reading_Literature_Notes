Play of self discovery, fool is the only one who knows himself.

Philology of nonsense : 

Do or not do? (Sir Andrew)

A universe of people getting things wrong. Its characters are nearly all mistake makers, and bumblers. Its polot runs on fuel mixed from erroneous judgements and poor decisions; and its resolution relies heavily on poorly considered marriages sanctified. Art or aestheic experience out of elaborate depiction of error.

"Baffled" : Olivia says that Malviolo has been baffled by the pranks. We are in on the mechanism that baffles others (Elizabethan comedy). We are also in on the fact that viola = cesario, sebastian is alive. We have already anticipated the recognition scene. The sense of befuddled wonder at the final scene belongs mainly to the play's characters. 

Although events don't befuddle us, the language does! (Use of Sir Andrew Aguecheek to model linguistic confusion). Pourquoi? 
Andrew = the play's idiot. Toby also inserts castiliano vulgo, whose meaning is unclear, so he's not alone with difficulty in romance language.

Point : Exact translation is not meaningful, the phrases express their point simply in explosive, meaningful noise. 
Toby draws line between him, andrew by use of romantic languages (french, spanish). Other characters in the play also emphasise on language, e.g. feste : Bonos Dies, greeting to malvolio imprisoned.

Ironic nonsense : Separate social or cultural action out of literal signification, Malviolo = focal point of this pattern. M O A I, doth sway my life -- nonsence, ant0sense. Malviolo plays part of text scholar who has long since decided what he has to say about object of study. "Crush this a litte" -- Makes him think it's his name in the letter. 

‘It is ironic, then that
in [Malvolio’s] desire to make the letter resemble something in himself, he is forced to transform that self,
both in appearance and conduct, if he is to follow the letter-writer’s advice and claim his reward. He must
become an anagram of himself.’ 

Malvolio, on the other hand, works very hard to
make sense out of nonsense. And as he reverses the Aguecheekian process, he
appears, horrifyingly, to know exactly what he is doing wrong.

The steward is punished for his analytical abilities in ways that eventually
shade into the sadistic territories of skimmington and bear-baiting, but before
he is sent to his dark hole of a prison, he puts on his ridiculous stockings and
smiles his unnatural smile. 

The play insults scholars who have spent lifetime in making sense out of nonsense! -> Theme of a reader/making sense.

But being baffled is certainly a common outcome of
Twelfth Night and early English comedy more generally. Our problems comprehending or translating the terms within it – in nonsensical foreign languages or
in English itself – can render us similar to the characters on stage

Olivia’s use of the term as she caps Malvolio’s humiliation is therefore much
more caustic than it is ordinarily taken to be. Her steward may have been
baffled like an armoured knight, but he will never, ever be one.

This completes treatment of nonsense, the word "baffled"

GENDER IN COMEDY

Comedy was linked with sexual and social transgression (early modern period). Shutting down of playhouses in London at all time high in 1570s, 

When the heroine Viola disguises herself
as a boy and attracts the amorous attentions of a noblewoman, she remarks,
using a misogynistic vocabulary that might have been drawn from one of the
antitheatrical pamphlets: “Disguise, I see thou art a wickedness / Wherein
the pregnant enemy does much” 


glorious demonstration of the range of gender possibilities available to early modern people. Viola disguises herself as a boy and wins the love of a man and a woman (Orsino and Olivia); her epicene twin brother Sebastian is beloved of both Olivia and the lovelorn Antonio.

Sebastian – born a male but indistinguishable from his sister – admits to Antonio that ‘my bosom is full of kindness, and I am yet so near the manners of my mother that upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell tales of me’.

By adopting the manners, habits and behaviours of a man, Viola has to all intents and purposes become one. Her maleness seems hard to shake off – Viola never changes out of her boy’s attire, and Orsino is still calling her Cesario in the final lines of the play, well after her identity as a woman has been revealed.

JESTING AND DISGUISE

And in the final act of the play both jesting and disguise turn sour. The victim
of a practical joke in which the disguised Feste takes part, a would-be lover
and social climber called Malvolio, finds himself in prison, suspected of being
possessed by “the pregnant enemy”—that is, the devil—and accused of heresy

Malvolio himself is described as “a kind of puritan”
(2.3.125), and his punishment could be seen as comedy’s symbolic revenge on its
enemies. But the revenge serves also to confirm the polemicists’ view that playing
with the fire of sexual passions, as Feste and his fellow pranksters do, may have
profoundly serious consequences, for the players as well as their victims.

Women had to be associated with passive qualities. So dramatists had to find ingenious ways of having women
speak without making them look immodest. One way to do this is disguise! woman -> man and then speaks.
d Viola forms part of a line of young
girls disguised as boys who populate Shakespeare’s plays, from Julia in The Two
Gentlemen of Verona to Imogen in Cymbeline.

two women who don’t feel the need to dress up as men in order to be articulate
or active. One is the Countess Olivia, an Elizabeth figure who insists on getting
what she wants regardless of custom and who freely exploits all the verbal
resources available to women of the ruling classes. The other is Olivia’s waiting
woman Maria, who represents a third class of active and articulate women: the
female trickster

The trio of articulate women who dominate Twelfth Night transform the
conventional Elizabethan ideal of a woman.

MORE DISGUISE

She never told her love,
But let concealment, like a worm i’ th’ bud,
Feed on her damask cheek. She pined in thought,
And with a green and yellow melancholy
She sat like patience on a monument,
Smiling at grief. (2.4.109–14)

t the disguised page tells his master the story of a wordless
woman, as a means of hinting at the nature of his own love for the duke. Cesario
had a sister, he explains, who fell in lov 

The men in this play have their own fantastic versions of the ideal woman,
and she too has little in common with the “real” women of flesh and blood we
see on stage. (The exception is Sir Toby, who has little patience for the ideal
invoked by his niece Olivia and who frankly admires the boldness and wit of
her maid, Maria.)

, aggressive manliness is
the subject of sometimes painful parody. One of Olivia’s would-be suitors, Sir
Andrew Aguecheek, is the comic antithesis of a man’s man: as Maria points out, 

 One of the pranks planned by Sir Toby
Belch is to expose Sir Andrew’s lack of manhood by pitting him in battle against
an equally “unmanly” foe, the boy Cesario, whom Sir Toby identifies as failing
to conform with the ideal of aggressive masculinity (pg 209 of harold bloom)
